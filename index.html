            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                
In my pursuit of a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science at Texas A&M University, my journey has led me to a diverse set of technical skills with a focused interest in software and data engineering. My commitment to holistic development is underscored by a minor in cybersecurity, enhancing my understanding of digital systems' intricacies. <br>

Proficient in languages such as Python, R, C/C++, JavaScript, and Java, I bring versatility to my projects, adapting across various technologies, from Z3 and HTML to CSS and Scheme. Navigating Linux environments like Ubuntu and delving into x86 Assembly, I've honed my skills in system understanding. Git and GitHub are integral tools in my workflow, ensuring collaborative and streamlined software development. <br>

My strong foundation in computer science principles, encompassing data structures and binary trees, showcases analytical prowess for intricate problem-solving. From designing efficient algorithms to implementing robust data storage solutions, I thrive on transforming theoretical knowledge into practical solutions. <br>

Actively seeking opportunities for internships, co-ops, and full-time roles, I am drawn to positions that not only challenge me but also foster continuous learning and growth. I aspire to contribute to cutting-edge projects that align with my passion for software and data engineering. <br>

Within my personal portfolio, you'll find a showcase of projects reflecting my enthusiasm, skills, and dedication to the field. My expertise extends to crafting data structures that optimize performance and scalability, demonstrating a keen understanding of the foundational aspects crucial to efficient software development. <br>

In considering potential companies, I am excited about organizations that prioritize innovation and provide an environment conducive to pushing boundaries. I am particularly drawn to companies that value not only technical excellence but also a culture of collaboration and ongoing skill development. <br>

I look forward to the prospect of contributing my technical proficiency to innovative endeavors, furthering both organizational success and my own professional development. As I actively seek opportunities to apply my skills, I am eager to align myself with companies that share my passion for pushing technological boundaries and fostering a culture of continuous learning. <br><br>
